I'm not sure what you mean by "auto". Could you provide more details about what you'd like to modify in your `launch.json` file?

For example, are you looking to:
- Add a new debug configuration?
- Auto-detect the Chrome port?
- Set up automatic startup?
- Something else?

Please clarify what changes you need.
